This is an open source platform for all to gather different solutions of each leetcode problem.
Its intended to gather solutions in different programming languages, and many variations which will help us to think from different approaching while solving a problem. 
Further more this could be like a know-it-all guide book for anyone who is starting to learn problem solving.
# File directory
Each problem needs to have its own directory containing its own readme for descriptive explanation to the solutions. 

As problem solving is not based on programming language rather based on logic read me is required for each problems instead of each language.

Each problem can be can have multiple solutions and can be written in multiple programming language too.
Hence directory is as follows: 


- root
  - problem1
    - language1
    - language2
  - problem2
    - language1
      - solution1
      - solution2   
      - solution3
    - language2
    - README.md
  - problem3


# How to contribute
The best way to contribute is to help others. This includes:

1. adding solutions to new problems
2. improving answer or solutions written by others
3. adding alternative solutions to existing solutions
4. improving exmplanations to a solution
5. code review, test yourself and merge other's pull request
